# iOS Photo Booth

Ok, so I wrote this for our wedding, which should be obvious to anyone bothering
to read the source or this ;). Myself and my wife searched the web trying to find something we could adapt and didn't find anything useful or functional.

This is released with a MIT license. Do what ever please, though it would be really cool for me to hear about it's use and to get feedback and to have my name buried in a source file still somewhere.

So here's what you can do to make this work for you!

1. Change the image in Assets.xcassets named "BrandImage" to whatever you want to
be in the bottom right corner of the photo strip.
2. Change the email subjects in ViewController.swift:302 to something less about me
and more about you!
3. I will be updating this with a UIPrintPageRenderer that works for the paper
and printer combo we've put together for our wedding, you might need to adjust
and test that yourself as well.

I'm putting this out there cause there just might be someone who has this idea
(all credit goes to Kim I'm just the code monkey) and would like to have something
simple to use with any old iPad they can find and a good stand. So if you find this
at all useful (or you have requests or find bugs) please open a pull request or an issue! YAY!
